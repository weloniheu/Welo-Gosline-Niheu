A little bit about me

Im currently a 3rd year computer science major at UCSD.

At the moment I am doing research with Edwin Solares, in computer vision and LLMS.

I have a lot to learn, but I incredibly excited to see what type of things I'll be able to learn in the computer science world and how it can apply to other areas.
